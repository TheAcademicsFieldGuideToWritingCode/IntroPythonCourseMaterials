    "# Understanding Python and Its Relevance in Social Sciences\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language, think of it as a new language you are learning, like Spanish or French, but this one is used to communicate with computers. In the social sciences, this language can be used to automate tasks, analyze and visualize data, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up Your Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you're planning to start a research project. Before you can delve into your research, first, you need to set up your workspace. You need your resources - books, articles, stat programs, etc. In the world of Python programming, your workspace is your development environment, and it has three main components: Python itself, a package manager (pip), and a virtual environment (like Poetry).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Python is like acquiring the fundamental theory book for your research. It is the primary tool you will use to conduct your analysis. You can't do much without it. To install Python, you'll need to download it from the official Python website and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing pip\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is a package manager for Python. Think of this as your library or database access. Just as you can't cite a source you can't access, you cannot use a Python package (like a pre-written script or tool) that you haven't installed. `pip` makes it simple to install those packages and keep them updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up a Virtual Environment using Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a way to keep your workspace clean and organized. Imagine you're working on two research papers simultaneously, one on psychology and one on sociology. You wouldn't want to mix up your psychology and sociology resources, would you? Similarly, a virtual environment helps you to separate and manage the resources (libraries, packages, Python versions) you are using for different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Command Line and Basic Bash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to use the command line is like learning to navigate your university's library system. It may seem intimidating at first, but it's a powerful tool once you get the hang of it. Bash commands are the steps you'll take to find the book you're looking for. For example, the `ls` command lists all the files in your current location (just like seeing all the books on a particular shelf), while the `cd` command allows you to change your directory (like moving to a different aisle in the library).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Python and its tools are not too different from the tools you use in your social sciences research. With practice, you'll be able to use Python to help you conduct more efficient and in-depth analysis."

    "# Setting Up a Development Environment With Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, and web development. In the field of social sciences, Python's data analysis libraries, such as pandas and NumPy, can be used to analyze and interpret complex data sets. Furthermore, Python is user-friendly, making it an excellent choice for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step in setting up your Python development environment is to install Python itself. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "2. Follow the instructions on the website to install Python on your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing pip\n",
    "\n",
    "pip is a package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage Python packages, which are software libraries that add functionality to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python 3.4 and later versions come with pip pre-installed. To check if pip is installed on your system, open your command line or terminal and type `pip --version`. If pip is installed, this command will display the version of pip installed on your system.\n",
    "2. If pip is not installed, you can install it using the following command on your command line or terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Unix/macOS:\n",
    "```\n",
    "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n",
    "python get-pip.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "For Windows:\n",
    "Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) to a folder on your computer. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py. Then run `python get-pip.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up a Virtual Environment Using Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install poetry by running the following command in your command line or terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Now you can create a new virtual environment with poetry. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new environment and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "poetry new my_project\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `my_project` with the name of your project. This will create a new directory with the name of your project, and it will set up a new virtual environment in that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the Command Line and Basic Bash Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is a text-based interface used to operate your computer. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a type of command line interpreter, or shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic bash commands that you will find useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd [directory]`: Changes the current directory. Replace `[directory]` with the name of the directory you want to navigate to.\n",
    "- `ls`: Lists all files and directories in the current directory.\n",
    "- `pwd`: Displays the path of the current directory.\n",
    "- `mkdir [directory]`: Creates a new directory. Replace `[directory]` with the name of the directory you want to create.\n",
    "- `rm [file]`: Deletes a file. Replace `[file]` with the name of the file you want to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these tools and knowledge, you're now ready to start working on Python projects in a robust and isolated environment. This will greatly assist your work within the domain of social sciences, where data analysis and interpretation are key. Python provides excellent libraries for these purposes, and understanding how to set up your Python environment is the first step towards leveraging these powerful tools."
